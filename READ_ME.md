### 2. Create a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a coded (h4ck3r 5p34k) version of the string.
       Examples
       hackerSpeak("javascript is cool") ➞ "j4v45cr1pt 15 c00l"
       hackerSpeak("programming is fun") ➞ "pr0gr4mm1ng 15 fun"

       Notes
       In order to work properly, the function should replace all 'a's with 4, 'e's with 3, 'i's with 1, 'o's with 0, and 's's with 5.
